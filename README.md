Hi, I work on Rust stuff.

## 1.0 Crates

Here's some crates I work on that are 1.0 that you might like:
* [bytemuck](https://docs.rs/bytemuck) does data transmutation, including of owned values, references, and even slices.
* [tinyvec](https://docs.rs/tinyvec) has a vector which lives on the stack when it's small enough. This is distinct from the `arrayvec` and `smallvec` crates because it contains no unsafe code at all.
