Hi, I work on Rust stuff.

## 1.0 Crates

Here's some cool crates I work on that are 1.0:
* [bytemuck](https://docs.rs/bytemuck) does data transmutation stuff, including of owned values, references, and even slices.
* [tinyvec](https://docs.rs/tinyvec) is a 100% safe code "small vector optimization" crate, where small enough vectors stay on the stack before moving themselves to the heap as necessary.
* [voladdress](https://docs.rs/voladdress) lets you easily do MMIO stuff.
